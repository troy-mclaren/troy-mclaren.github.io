          <p>
            I am currently in my third year at the University of Auckland, studying a conjoint degree in Engineering (Hons) and Law, specialising in Software Engineering. I can relate well with others and am a valuable team player. I am enthusiastic about learning and developing my skill-set and consider myself a fast learner. I am professional, diligent and pay close attention to detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have achieved a number of awards in my degree so far, placing on the Engineering Dean's Honours list in 2016 and attaining a First in Course award for my Digital Systems Paper. I also received the University of Auckland Scholarship (monetary value up to $50,000) in entering my first year.
